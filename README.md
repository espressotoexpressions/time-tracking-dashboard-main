i really like the way you coded your js, the use of .map is something i hadnt though of and is really cool/creative, you also were able to shorten your code a lot at the top compared to how many elements i have which i thought was awesome

the only things i can think to recommend are making the site start with weekly on load instead of daily and playing around with the "Object-Position:" feature on your header images

amazing job, thank you for thinking of creative solutions to help me widen my ideas
